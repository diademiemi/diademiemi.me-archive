            <p class="header">Hi there, I'm diademiemi</p>
            <p>I'm a beginning software dev and Linux sysadmin. I've always had a passion for technology and I'm always learning.</p>
            <p>My name is Emilia and my pronouns are they/them or she/her. I'm 17 years old and located in the Netherlands.</p>
            <p>I'm familiar with Python and Java, and I'm learning Rust. I have a deep hatred for Minecraft, but I keep making projects with it for some damned reason.</p>
            <p>While I'm still pretty new to development, I'm trying to learn as much as I can. I haven't contributed to much yet, but I want to change that. I also want to do some hardware projects in the future too.</p>
            <p>I'm in college for system administration & networking, but my Linux and development experience is all self-taught. I'm currently taking an internship to learn more about the Linux ecosystem and infrastructure, more specifically Red Hat products.</p>
            <p>I try to use only open source software where possible, and because of that I try to root/jailbreak my devices when I can. I hope to be able to contribute to projects like those in the future, for example by porting new devices.</p>
